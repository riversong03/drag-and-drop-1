Drag and drop quiz activity, developed with jQuery, XML, HTML, and CSS.

Drag and Drop Activity Using XML and jQuery
===========================================

## Getting Started

This project contains all of the code needed for a learning activity or quiz.  

The content of the quiz can be easily changed by creating an XML document with the same tag structure as the one used in this project.  

To change the XML file being used, just swap out the path of the file in this line:

    ```
    xhttp.open("GET","LMS_exercises.xml", false);  
    ```
    
and change it to the location of the new XML file you wish to use.

If you run the code on your local machine, you may need to use a local web server application to get the xhttp request method to function correctly.
